00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.480
Technology is everywhere.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.040
It's become
a fundamental part of modern life.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.160
The internet has brought the world
to our finger tips,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.440
and we have all come to depend on it
in many ways,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.520
both at home and at work.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.880
Did you know that data is now one of the
most valuable commodities in the world?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.240
The data that makes up each of our digital
footprints is extremely valuable.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.840
Which, sadly, makes it a prime target
for cyber crime.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.440
Online criminals and hackers

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.480
want to get their hands on your data,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.160
and it can be easy to fall
for their sneaky techniques.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200
It's important
to know what to look out for

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.840
and what steps to take
if their tricks succeed

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.200
and you come face to face
with a cyber attack at some point.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.040
That's where cyber security comes in.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.800
Cyber security's core
function is to protect the devices we use

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.680
and the data we store on them from theft,
damage and unauthorised access.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.800
It may seem daunting,
but cyber security is driven by people,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.560
not technology, so we can all do our bit.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.000
People are responsible
for what happens to their data,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.400
and you probably already have more control
than you might think.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.920
At work, your organisation should be doing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.680
lots of things behind the scenes
to protect you from cyber attacks,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.160
but you can play your part
by taking a few steps.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.520
That's where this training comes in.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.480
It gives you clear, actionable steps
and advice

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.840
to protect yourself
from the most common cyber attacks.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.800
Together, we can make the UK

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.520
the safest place
for you to live and work online.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.760
So, let's get started!
